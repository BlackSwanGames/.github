In realms where dreams take wing and fly,  
Where pixels dance and stories lie,  
There dwells a place, both bold and grand,  
Whose name is known as Black Swan's brand.  

With artistry akin to a painter's stroke,  
They craft worlds where wonders cloak,  
In every corner, a tale to tell,  
In every code, a magic spell.  

From soaring skies to oceans deep,  
Their games invite us to boldly leap,  
Into realms of fantasy, adventure, and lore,  
Where heroes rise and villains roar.  

With controllers gripped and hearts alight,  
We journey through their realms of sight,  
Through realms where dragons breathe their flame,  
And echoes carry each hero's name.  

In Black Swan's world, we find release,  
From the mundane, we find our peace,  
For in their games, we're free to be,  
Explorers of vast digital seas.  

So here's to Black Swan, the creators divine,  
Whose every game is a sacred shrine,  
To the power of dreams, and the joy they bring,  
Long may their melodies forever sing.
